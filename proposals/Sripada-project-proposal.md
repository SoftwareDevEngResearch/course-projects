--->  Functionality: The aim of the project is to simulate an environment (the GUI of the environment is not first priority though I will make it as appealing as possible) in which multiple agents collect a set of waypoints and return to their initial/desired positions. I would like to divide this into parts 

1) A single agent starting, collecting waypoints and going back to the initial location in minimum time. I will use reinforcement learning for this (I would like to learn this alongside the class work). Doing this is the minimum expected result by the end of term.  

2) Two agents doing the above task

3) More than two agents doing the specified task.

	Input: The waypoints in the map.
	Output: Best path to collect all these without falling in a trap.

--->  Usage: I want to make an open source code for people wanting to work on multi agent learning. I have seen people working on things like multi robots playing hide and seek for whom my code will be very helpful.

--->  Prior work: I have done work on planning and coordination for multiple agents but have not used learning. I have cited two such papers that are on multi agent learning. The first has a hunter catch a prey. The second has two robots evade from two catching robots. Here both pairs have two differnt objectives.

1) Ming Tan, "Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning: Independent vs Cooperative Agents".

2) Maxim Egorov, "Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning"

--->  Librariries: I will most likely be using some of 'RLLab', 'PyBrain', 'OpenAI Gym' libraries.
