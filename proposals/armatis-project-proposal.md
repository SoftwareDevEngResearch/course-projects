# ME 599 Project Proposal
## Motivation
Flow maldistribution and instability can be detrimental to heat exchanger effectiveness and integrity. Hot spots can form and damage the heat exchanger. This is especially true for varying heat fluxes and two-phase flow. Passive control of flow in individual channels could increase the life and performace of a heat exchanger. Using bimetallic strips or other shape memory materials, geometries could be fabricated to adjust flow based on the fluid temperature.
