Because  nuclear weapons release specific radioxenon isotopes when detonated, the identification of radioxenon isotopes in the atmosphere is a key way that the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO) monitors the earth for clandestine nuclear weapons testing. These radioxenon isotopes are identified using various radiation detection systems placed in remote locations all around the world [1]. My research involves the development of detection systems to be used for this effort. The work involves taking atmospheric samples, injecting the gas into the detection system, and attempting to identify if radioxenon gas is present in statistically significant quantities.

A reliable way to determine if said radioxenon is present in an atmospheric sample is by searching for specific patterns in coincidence events. The radioxenon isotopes in question each emit an electron and a photon at specific energies at virtually the same time upon decaying, a phenomenon known as beta-gamma coincidence decay. By examining a 2D histogram of a spectrum of coincidence events obtained (electrons vs photons), one can discern a specific beta-gamma signature for each radioxenon isotope [2]. However, three of the four radioxenon isotopes of interest have interfering beta-gamma signatures, i.e.: a part of their beta-gamma signature overlaps with that of another radioxenon isotope. To further complicate this, the electron detector utilized in the system is made of a relatively high-Z material, which results in the detection system experiencing electron backscatter (where electrons deposit only part of their energy in the detecting medium), and thus does not present the expected radioxenon signature [3]. These issues are expected to introduce exceptional difficulty when injecting mixed samples.

**Figure 1: A 2D histogram plot for a measurement of Xe-131m, conducted with my detection system. Photon energy is on the y-axis, and electron energy is on the x-axis. Ideally, this would be a single point of at x=129, y=30, plus spread due to statistics and resolution; however, there is a significant low-energy tail due to incomplete electron energy deposition (i.e.: backscatter)**

It is this interference and backscatter problem that I would like to attempt to address in this project. I want to investigate how a spectrum can be broken into its constituent parts and determine what amount of the spectrum is likely to come from certain radioxenon isotopes. I believe this can best be done by using the maximum likelihood estimation statistical method. This has been shown to be effective in the past for radioxenon applications [4], but it has never been utilized to address backscatter concerns (as traditionally the detectors used in these systems do not experience backscatter). Beyond simply addressing backscatter, the algorithm is fairly straightforward to implement in an algorithm and produces competitive to superior results to conventional methods, particularly in situation with poor counting statistics (a circumstance likely to exist in the field) [5]. 

Thus, my plan for this term is to design a software package that can discern radioxenon isotopes in an experimentally obtained spectrum using maximum likelihood estimation. This will be done by examining ideal mono-isotopic spectra obtained from Monte Carlo methods (MCNP) and determining if certain radioxenon isotopes are present, and if so, how much. The experimental data is taken via a field programmable gate array (FPGA) and interpreted by a MATLAB user interface, which stores the 2D spectra in a histogram array of arbitrary size. The code package would extract the information from these arrays and form them into a vector. The code package will then read in data from several MCNP simulations, one for each radioxenon isotope, that have been formatted the same way the experimental data was formatted. An additional spectrum for background will either be simulated or experimentally obtained. The code will then execute a maximum likelihood procedure, which involves conducting a series of iterations on a weighting equation until the code converges on a set of relative quantities radioxenon isotopes and background that would be most likely to result in the spectrum experimentally observed [5]. The project will make use of NumPy for matrix operations and will use Python to extract data from the data files produced by MATLAB and MCNP, as well as output the final results in a list form. If time allows, the code will be tested using additional simulation data for mixed spectra to determine how the code performs in low counting statistics situations. I do not intend to add a GUI, as I feel that it is unnecessary for the intent of the project. 

This software package will primarily be intended for use by me. However, because the data it takes as input is simply an array of values, the code should work equally well using data sourced from codes other than MATLAB or MCNP, so long as the data is in said array format. As this is the case, the code will be flexible enough to be utilized by any research group that intend to use the code for similar radioxenon spectrum analysis. Because the code will use no proprietary information, it will be made available for other researchers to utilize as they see fit.
